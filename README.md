# LettuceWrap-Standalone

LettuceWrap is a lightweight Bukkit plugin designed to make utilizing PubSub messaging from lettuce.io clean and easy. For more information, see [lettuce.io](http://lettuce.io). This libraru is only designed to subscribe (listen) to channels and publish messages to channels. Patterns and listening for subscribing/unsubscribing is NOT supported. This library may be expanded in the future to accommodate more redis features.

**NOTE:** This project is essentially a copy of the [original LettuceWrap](https://github.com/magicmq/LettuceWrap), but it is now a standalone library that should be shaded into your own plugin.
